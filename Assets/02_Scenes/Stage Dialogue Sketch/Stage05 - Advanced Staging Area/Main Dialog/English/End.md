Excellent!
You successfully executed the command 'git reset .'
and moved all files in the project back to 'Unstaged'.

Following the stage tutorial, 
you are already familiar with the advanced usage of commands. 

In this stage, you learn advanced commands, which are:
1. 'git add folder_name'
2. 'git reset folder_name'
3. 'git add .'
4. 'git reset .'

These commands allow you to add or remove files in bulk.
They control the status of the 'Staging Area' effectively.

After completing this stage, 
we can now move on to the next goal. 

In this stage, we successfully added the modified file content to 'Staged'.

Now, it's time to move the changes to the 'Repository'.

In the next stage, we will submit the first version of the project.
Then understand the structure inside the 'Repository'.

Finally, congratulations on completing this stage.
You did a great job!
