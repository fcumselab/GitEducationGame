Welcome to the 'Advanced Operations in Git Staging Area' Stage!

First, let's quickly review the knowledge and commands learned in the previous stage.

In the last stage, we further learned the 'Staging Area'.

We use three commands: 'git status', 'git add', and 'git reset'.
To interact with the 'Staging Area'.

The 'git status' command opened the 'Staging Area' window,
and see the structure and contents in it.

We used the 'git add' and 'git reset' commands
to move specific files into or out of the 'Staging Area'.

In this stage, 
we will learn more advanced commands to operate the 'Staging Area'.

Next, let's simulate the background story for this stage.

After completing the simulation, 
please open the 'File Manager' window to check the files on the computer.
