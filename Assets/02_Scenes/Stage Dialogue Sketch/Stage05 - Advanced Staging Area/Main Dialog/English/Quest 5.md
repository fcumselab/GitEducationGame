Excellent!
You used the command 'git reset folder_name'
to move all files in 'Folder B' back to 'Untracked'.

However, since you can add 'file name' and 'folder name' in front of a command.

Is there a way to add all files in the project to the 'Staging Area' at once?

The answer is yes!

By adding a '.' symbol in front of the 'git add' command.
You can add all files in the current path of the 'Command Line' to 'Staged'.

But be careful,
using the 'git add .' command might move files you don't want to upload to the 'Staging Area'.

So, after using this command, 
please pay attention to the status of the 'Staging Area'.

Now, please try entering the command '<color=#CF001C>git add .</color>'.
Then confirm that all files in the project have been added to 'Staged'.
