Great!
You've executed another feature of the 'git add' command: 
'<color=#CF001C>git add folder_name</color>'.

Looking at the 'Staging Area' window, 
you can notice that all files in 'Folder B' have been added to 'Staged'.

You could still use 'git add file_name' to add files from the folder to 'Staged' one by one.

But if you learn how to use this command,
you can control the system more conveniently.

Now, let's move all files in 'Folder B' back to 'Untracked'.

By adding 'folder name' in front of 'git reset'.
'<color=#CF001C>git reset folder_name</color>' can move all files in the folder to 'Untracked' at once.

If you forget the function of the 'git reset' command, 
please refer to the game manual.
