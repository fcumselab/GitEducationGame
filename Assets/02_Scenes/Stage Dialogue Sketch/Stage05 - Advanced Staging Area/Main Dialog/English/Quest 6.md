Great!
You used the command 'git add .' to move all files in the project to the 'Staging Area'.

Next, following the previous process, 
let's move all the files out of the 'Staging Area'. 
This is the last command we learned in this stage.

This time, please add a '.' symbol before the 'git reset' command.
Then execute the command '<color=#CF001C>git reset .</color>' to achieve the goal.
Good luck!
