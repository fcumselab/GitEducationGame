Great! 
After executing the command, 
the content in the 'Commit History' window has been updated.

Another 'commit' has been added to the area,
and it connected to the first 'commit'.

In the Git system, the 'Commit History' is like a timeline.
Each commit is a mark on this timeline.

The newest 'commit' is at the top of the timeline, 
while the earliest 'commit' is at the bottom.

The connections between 'commits' show the relationships between them.

By viewing the 'Commit History',
you can better understand how the Git system records the differences between versions.

Now, please create a third 'commit' on your own!
This will practice the process of 'creating commits'.
Good luck!
