Great! 
You have successfully created the second version of the presentation.

Now, to ensure that our operations are correct,
please check the status of the 'Staging Area' again.

In actual work, 
confirming the status of the 'Staging Area' and 'Commit History' might not always be necessary.
But checking the status after executing commands is a good habit.

Now, please confirm again if 'Midterm_Report.ppt'
has been successfully moved from the 'Staging Area' to the 'Repository'.
