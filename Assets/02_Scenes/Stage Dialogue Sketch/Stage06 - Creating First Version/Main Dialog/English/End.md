Excellent! 
You have added a third 'commit'
and confirmed the status of the 'Staging Area' and 'Commit History'.

I believe that the practice at this stage 
has increased your understanding of the creating commits process.

In this stage, we used the 'git commit -m' command
to move files from the 'Staging Area' to the 'Repository'.

These files become a record and are stored in the 'Commit History' area,
which is part of the 'Repository'.

Then, using the 'git log' command, we confirmed the contents of the 'Commit History'.
And we understand the relationships between 'commits'.

After completing this stage, 
you are now ready to start using Git commands to manage projects in development!

However, although we learned how to create commits,
we do not know how to switch versions yet.

In the next stage, we will learn how to move the HEAD to other commits.

Finally, congratulations on passing this stage.
You did very well!
