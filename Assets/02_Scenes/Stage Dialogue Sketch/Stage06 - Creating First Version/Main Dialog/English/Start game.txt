Welcome to the 'Creating Your First Git Project Version' stage!

In this stage, you will learn how to create the first version of your Git project.

First, let's quickly review the knowledge and commands we learned in the last stage.

In the previous stage, we further understood the structure of the 'Staging Area'.
And learned the advanced usage of 'git add' and 'git reset'.

By adding a 'folder_name' or '.' symbol before the command,
we can move files into or out of the 'Staging Area' effectively.

After reviewing the content of the previous stage, 
let's start this tutorial.

Next, let's simulate the background for this stage.

After setting up the stage scene,
please open the 'File Manager' window to check the files on the computer.
