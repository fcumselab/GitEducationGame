Great! 
You successfully opened the 'Commit History' window with the 'git log' command.

Now, let's take a look at the contents of it.

First, you will notice a circle icon in the window.
It represents the first version we created from the 'Staging Area'.

In the Git system, these versions are known as 'commits'.

You can click on the circle icon of the 'commit' to view its detailed contents.

In the pop-up window, you will see information about the commit.
Including the date, author, and the message you entered earlier.
This information helps you understand the changes made in this 'commit'.

Next, in the branch field,
you will see 'HEAD -> master'. 
This line shows which branch the 'commit' belongs to.

''master' is the default branch in the Git system.
Usually, we make commits on the 'master' branch.

In the 'Git Basics' theme stage, 
we will only use the 'master' branch.

Concepts about branches will be further introduced 
in the next theme stage â€” 'Branch Management'.

Next, let's understand what 'HEAD' is.

Please use the left mouse button to click on
any area of the 'Commit History' window to close the pop-up.

In the left-side list of the 'Commit History' window,
you can see all branch names and corresponding icons in the current 'Repository'.

Branches are represented in different colors. 
For example, commits belonging to the 'master' branch
are displayed with a blue circle and an 'M' letter icon.

The flag icon means that HEAD is on which 'commit' now.

When there are multiple versions of a project,
you can use commands to switch between different versions.

Now, please use the 'git commit -m' command again
to create the second version of the presentation.

However, to successfully create a 'commit',
the file needs to be modified and added to the 'Staging Area'
before you create a second commit.

Please open the 'Midterm_Report.ppt' and correct the errors in the file.
