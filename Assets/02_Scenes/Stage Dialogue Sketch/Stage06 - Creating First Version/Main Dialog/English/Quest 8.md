Alright, after updating the status of the 'Staging Area', 
the 'Midterm_Report.ppt' file has reappeared in the 'Untracked' area.

The Git system compared the file differences between the 'Working Directory' and the 'First Commit Version'.
And noticed a difference in the content of 'Midterm_Report.ppt'.

Additionally, the first line in the list shows a pencil icon.
It means that the file content has been modified.

Next, please add the presentation back to the 'Staging Area'.
After completing, please update the status of the 'Staging Area' again.
