Alright, after opening the 'Staging Area' window,
you will notice that the 'Midterm_Report.ppt' file does not appear in
either the 'Unstaged' or 'Staged' areas.

This shows that you have successfully created the first version of it.

When the Git system compares the file differences between the 'Working Directory' and the 'First Commit Version',
it does not find any changes in the report content.

Therefore, the 'Staging Area' currently contains no tracked files.

Next, we will learn how to check the commit status of versions.

In the 'Repository', there is an area specifically for storing 'Commit History'.
We can view the contents of this area through commands.

Using the '<color=#CF001C>git log</color>' command will display all version records in the 'Repository',
and the output results will be shown in the 'Command Line' window.

However, just like with 'git status',
this game has made the output of the 'git log' command
into a separate window â€” the 'Commit History' window.

For more information about the 'git log' command,
you can refer to the game manual.

Next, please open the 'Commit History' window
using the '<color=#CF001C>git log</color>' command.
