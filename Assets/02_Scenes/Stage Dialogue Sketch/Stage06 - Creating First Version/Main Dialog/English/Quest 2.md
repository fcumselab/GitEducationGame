Alright, after opening the 'File Manager' window, 
the files on the computer are similar to Stage 1.

We also need to prepare a midterm report for the course.
But this time, we will use the Git system to manage it.

After creating the Git management system, 
the 'Repository' is initially without any records.

Therefore, in the first version.
We need to add the files to be managed into the 'Repository'.

Next, to manage the midterm report with Git.
Please add the file to the 'Staging Area' first.

Once you added the file to 'Staged', 
it's ready to be pushed the changed to the 'Repository'.
