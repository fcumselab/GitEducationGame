Excellent! You have successfully added the presentation to the 'Staging Area'.

After confirming the content to be committed, 
next, we will execute a new command to move the content from the 'Staging Area' to the 'Repository'.
These contents will be saved as the first version of the report.

The command is '<color=#CF001C>git commit -m</color>'. 
Let's understand the structure of this command.

The 'git commit' command will save the contents of the 'Staging Area' 
as a new version and record it in the 'Repository'.

The '-m' (Message) shows that 
we can add a commit message before the command.

Before submitting the new version, 
we must fill in a commit message for these changes.

When writing a commit message, 
it is important to ensure the content is <color=#CF001C>clear, concise, and meaningful</color>.
This helps others understand the purpose and content of the file changes.

In this game, when executing the 'git commit -m' command, 
the system asks you to choose the most suitable message from the options.

To use this command in the game,
please follow these steps:

1. Enter '<color=#CF001C>git commit -m</color>' in the input field.

2. Add a space after '-m', become:
'<color=#CF001C>git commit -m </color>'.

3. Since Git commands are separated by spaces, 
enclose the commit message in quotation <color=#CF001C>"</color> when writing it. 
It should look like: '<color=#CF001C>git commit -m ""</color>'

4. In this game, you don't need to enter the commit message manually. 
After completing the previous step, press the Tab key or the search button to open the commit message options.
Select the most appropriate commit message from there.

5. After selection, the content in the input field should be:
'<color=#CF001C>git commit -m "Selected_commit_message"</color>'.

Please follow these steps to create your first project version.
