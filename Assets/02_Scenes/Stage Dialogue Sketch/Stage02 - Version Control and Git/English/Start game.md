Welcome to the 'Introduction to Version Control and Git' stage!

In this stage, we will focus on explaining concepts without practical operations.
However, in the end, there’s a quiz to enhance your understanding.

Correct answers will give you 1000 points.
Incorrect answers will not get any points.

There are four chapters in this stage:
1. Review the Stage 1
2. What is Version Control?
3. What is Git?
4. Summary

At the end of each chapter, you can choose whether to continue to the next chapter.

Chapter 1 - 'Review of Level 1'

Before introducing version control and Git, let's review Stage 1 first.

In Stage 1, we used the 'backup file' method to complete the midterm presentation.

Although this method is direct and fast, 
it can cause problems when dealing with more complex presentations or projects.

First, if there’s a large number of backup files during development, 
it will be difficult to track the differences between files.

If a serious error occurs and you have to go back to the previous versions, 
you will spend a lot of time on fixing errors.

Second, your work environment becomes messy 
because of multiple backup files.

You might even encounter situations like:
1. Developed the content on old versions of files
2. Overwriting the current development file while backing up files.

To avoid these issues, 
we can use a version control system to help us manage projects.

Next, let's go to Chapter 2 - 'What is Version Control?'
Do you need to take a break?


=====================================

Chapter 2 - 'What is Version Control'

First, let's get to know what is version control.
Version control is one of the main roles in software development.
But is not limited to programming-related fields.

In fact, if there’s a project that requires long-term operation and development.
It can be effectively managed with version control.

For example, graphic designers or web designers might modify images several times while editing.
In this scenario, version control can be appropriate to help people manage the images.

The main goal of version control is to better manage changes in files. 
It records every modification during the development.

Here are the benefits of version control:

1. History Tracking: 
It allows you to view every change made to files, 
including who made the changes, when they were made, 
and the specific content of the changes.

2. Rollback Function: 
If you encounter errors or need to go back to the previous version, 
version control can easily return to a previous version without affecting the current development.

3. Branch Management: 
It allows you to create branches for development, 
and lets different features be developed at the same time without interference.

The benefits of version control above,
we will further understand and practically operate in later stages.

Next, let's go to Chapter 3 - 'What is Git?'
Do you need to take a break?

Chapter 3 - 'What is Git?'

After understanding what version control is, let's learn about Git.

Git is a powerful version control tool, 
it’s highly popular in software development.

The developers of Git integrated the concept of version control into it.

Users will operate version control functions through 
executing Git commands in the Command Line.

Here are some advantages of using Git:

Team Collaboration: 
Git allows team members to develop a project at the same time without interfering with each other's work.
And members can easily merge files.

Branch Strategy: 
Git's branch management feature smoothens the project development process. 
You can create different branches, each focused on specific goals. Once the development branches are complete, they can be merged into the main branch.
It enhances project stability.

Version Tracking: 
Every file submission is recorded and stored in Git.
You can easily view each submission content.

Easy to Learn:
Even if you are not a programmer or never touched programming,
Git's concepts are relatively simple. 
You can execute simple Git commands to control the system.

In this game, Git commands are adjusted.
We will focus on practical commands and remove difficult ones.

Next, let's go to Chapter 4 - 'Summary'.
Do you need to take a break?


==================

Chapter 4 - 'Summary'

In conclusion, version control significantly enhances project development efficiency and organizes content management.

For historical records and version tracking features,
we can clearly see the differences between file versions.

The rollback function allows us to go back to the previous version, 
it helps us view historical content and fix problems.

The branching system increases stability and efficiency for project development.

Finally, version control supports team collaboration, 
allowing team members to develop features together and 
integrate completed content into the project.


=======

After understanding what version control and Git are,
let's have a quiz.

In the quiz, the questions and options will help you review the knowledge you've just learned.

Now, let's simulate a background story. 
You are a student in the 'Project Management' course.
Please use the knowledge you've just learned to answer quiz questions.

Before starting, you can review the content again 
through the 'Assistant feature' and 'Game Manual'.

The quiz system has been added to this computer. 
When you're ready to answer, click on the quiz system to begin.
Good luck!
