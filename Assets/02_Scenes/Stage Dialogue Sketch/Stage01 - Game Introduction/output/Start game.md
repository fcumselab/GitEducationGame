Wonderful!\r\nYou have successfully modified the third version of the midterm report,\r\nmaking the report even more perfect.
With two modifications,\r\nyou have now prepared the midterm report\r\nand achieved the main objective of this simulated stage.
After completing the first stage,\r\nI believe you have a clearer understanding of \r\nthe game's walkthrough and gameplay.
Next, let's review what we learned in this stage.
First, we introduced the game's goals and features,\r\nand various features in the game,\r\nsuch as scoring, objectives, and simulated background stories.
Then, we unlocked several features in the game.
The 'Dialogue feature' not only allows you to review previous conversations\r\nbut also provides 'Hint' and 'Answer' features.
The 'Game Manual' is a tool to help you learn.\r\nAs the game progresses, you will unlock more knowledge.\r\nPlease use it whenever needed.
The 'File Manager' window allows you to\r\nbrowse the contents of the computer \r\nin the simulated background environment.
And you can do actions on files:\r\nadd, modify, delete file contents,\r\nas well as copy and name files.
In this stage, we used the actions of backing up files\r\nto help you get familiar with the game environment.
In the next stage, \r\nwe will start learning about version control and Git.
We will understand their definitions, advantages, and features.\r\nAt the same time, we will compare\r\nthe differences between using 'file backup' and 'version control'.
Finally, congratulations on completing the stage.\r\nYou did a great job!
