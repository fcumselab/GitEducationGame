Hello!
Welcome to the Git Education Game!

Before the game starts,
Let me introduce the features and goals of this game.

In this game,
you will learn what version control is.
And you will use Git commands to operate action during the game.

Even those without programming experience,
or those who have never used Git version control tools.
They can learn these skills through this game.

The main goals of this game will teach you:
1. Basic concepts of version control and how to apply it effectively.
2. The purpose of using each Git command, and how to use them.
3. How to manage projects practically with these skills.

To achieve these goals above,
situations and problems will be simulated in this game, 
which is often encountered in actual project development.

Based on the difficulty and theme of each situation,
the game has designed multiple stages.

This approach not only helps you
learn the knowledge at each level more effectively.

But also allows you to use this knowledge
in actual project development after completing the game.

After introducing the game's goals and features,
let's get familiar with the game environment.

First, let's simulate the first game scene.

After establishing the simulated scene,
you can see the background story in 
the 'Current Simulation Background' area.

In the game,
we need to play the role of the characters in the simulated scene.
We have to do action on the game screen to achieve the main goals of the story.

Once you reach the main goal in the simulated scene, 
you clear the stage.

Additionally, to ensure you clearly understand 
each step you should take during the game.

The main goal will be divided into multiple smaller objectives.
You can confirm the current game objective at the top left of the game screen.

Before we start complete the first objective,
let's confirm the story background together.

According to the current simulated scene,
you have added a mid-term presentation to this computer.

To finish the min-term presentation,
We need to open the 'File Manager' window to change files.

The game has added the first objective.
Now, let's focus on completing the current goal.

To open the 'File Manager' window,
we need to find the corresponding button in the 'Toolbar' area and click on it.

In this game, 
the 'Toolbar' contains multiple windows.
They are all related to version control.

As the game progresses,
you will unlock and operate new windows.

Now, the 'File Manager' button has been unlocked.
After finishing this dialogue, 
please click the corresponding button with the left mouse button to open the window.

Finally, if you encounter any problems during the game,
please feel free to click here for help.
You can do it!
