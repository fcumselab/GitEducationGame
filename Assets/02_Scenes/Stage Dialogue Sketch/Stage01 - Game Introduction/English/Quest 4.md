Good!
You have renamed the backup file.
We can identify the differences between the files more easily.

After finishing the action of backup files.
Let's start simplifying the content of the presentation.

Similarly, you can use the 'File Content' window
to add, modify, and delete content.

Please note that the current objective is to delete content
from '<color=#CF001C>MidtermReport_v2.ppt</color>'.

So before you delete the file content,
please ensure that the file in the 'File Content' window is the target one.
to avoid deleting the content in an old file version.
