Wonderful!
You have successfully modified the third version of the midterm report,
making the report even more perfect.

With two modifications,
you have now prepared the midterm report
and achieved the main objective of this simulated stage.

After completing the first stage,
I believe you have a clearer understanding of 
the game's walkthrough and gameplay.

Next, let's review what we learned in this stage.

First, we introduced the game's goals and features,
and various features in the game,
such as scoring, objectives, and simulated background stories.

Then, we unlocked several features in the game.

The 'Dialogue feature' not only allows you to review previous conversations
but also provides 'Hint' and 'Answer' features.

The 'Game Manual' is a tool to help you learn.
As the game progresses, you will unlock more knowledge.
Please use it whenever needed.

The 'File Manager' window allows you to
browse the contents of the computer 
in the simulated background environment.

And you can do actions on files:
add, modify, delete file contents,
as well as copy and name files.

In this stage, we used the actions of backing up files
to help you get familiar with the game environment.

In the next stage, 
we will start learning about version control and Git.

We will understand their definitions, advantages, and features.
At the same time, we will compare
the differences between using 'file backup' and 'version control'.

Finally, congratulations on completing the stage.
You did a great job!
