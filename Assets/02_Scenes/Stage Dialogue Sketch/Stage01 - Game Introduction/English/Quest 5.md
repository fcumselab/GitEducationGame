Great!
You have successfully simplified the content 
in the 'MidtermReport_v2.ppt' file.

After simplifying the report contents,
you reviewed the report content again.

As a result, you found that one page of the presentation 
needs to change to make the content smoother.

Let's go through the 'Backup File' process once again
to complete the midterm report.

This time, you need to complete the stage objectives by yourself.
After completing one objective, I won't tell you what to do next.

Please try to complete the objective 
with the knowledge you have just learned.

If you encounter problems during the game,
please use the 'Game Manual' or click 'Help Feature' for assistance.
Let's do it!
