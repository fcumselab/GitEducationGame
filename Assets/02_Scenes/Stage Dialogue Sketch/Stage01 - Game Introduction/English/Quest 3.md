Well done!
After successfully backing up the file,
let's move to the next step, continue to simplify the presentation content.

However, before we start, there's one more important thing need to complete:
We should rename the copied file.
It can identify file differences more easily.

Therefore, please name the copied file.

In this simulated computer,
if you need to name files,
you need to do it in the 'File Content' window.

Please click on the target file 
with the left mouse button to open the 'File Content' window.

For how to do action in the 'File Editing' window.
This time we encourage you to try exploring by yourself or 
use the game manual for more information.
