Well done! \r\nAfter executing the 'git init' command,\r\na new folder appeared in your project location.
This command creates a folder named '.git' at the specified location.
This folder is 'hidden' in the computer system,\r\nmeaning you do not need to modify its contents directly.\r\nInstead, you will use various Git commands to interact with it.
'.git' is the core of the entire Git system.\r\nIt contains important information related to the project, \r\nsuch as versions of submissions, authors, time, etc. 
Without the '.git' folder, most Git commands cannot operate normally.
Now, let me briefly introduce the three areas that are contained in Git:
First is the 'Working Directory.' \r\nThis area is actually the project location you chose. 
All files in the 'Working Directory' are tracked by Git, \r\nwhich is the 'Ongoing Project' folder.
Next is the 'Staging Area.' \r\nThis area acts as a bridge between the 'Working Directory' and the '.git' folder.
You can push file modification contents\r\nfrom the 'Working Directory' to the 'Staging Area'.
Then move the confirmed files to the '.git' to create a record.
Finally, the 'Repository.' \r\nThe management system created on your local computer is called the 'Local Repository.'
In fact, the 'Repository' is the '.git' folder.
In the upcoming stages, \r\nwe will introduce in more detail the 'Staging Area' and 'Local Repository,' \r\nand operate them using Git commands.
With this operation, \r\nyou have successfully achieved the simulation scenario's objective.
Using the newly unlocked 'Command Line' window,\r\nyou executed the 'git -v' and 'git init' commands\r\nto create a new Git management system.
We also understood the role and structure of the '.git' folder.
In the next stage,\r\nwe will further understand \r\nthe contents of the 'Staging Area' and operate it through commands.
Finally, congratulations on completing this tutorial stage.\r\nWell done!
