Great! You have successfully opened the 'Command Line' window.

Next, let's understand the features in the window. 
You can refer to the game manual if needed later.

First is the 'Command History' area. 
It records the commands you have executed previously.

The button in the top right corner of the window can clear the command history.
You can press it if you need it.

Next is the 'Command Details' area. 
The results of the executed commands will be displayed here. 

Also, if you hover the mouse over a command in the 'Command History',
you can also see the message after execution.

Then, at the bottom, is the 'Enter Command' area.
This is the most important part of the 'Command Line', 
where you can enter and execute commands.

The first line shows the current folder location.
Just like the 'File Management' window, the command line also has its current location.

To help your learning of Git commands, 
you only need to move the path in the 'File Manager' window, 
and the 'Command Line' window will move in sync.

The last column is where you enter commands.

After introducing the features of the 'Command Line' window, 
let's try entering a command right away.

Please note that:
'when entering commands, the case you enter needs to be the same'
This can help Git to recognize the command.

Now, please click on the input field, 
enter '<color=#CF001C>git --version</color>' or '<color=#CF001C>git -v</color>', 
and then press the Enter key on your keyboard or the arrow next to the input field to execute your first command.
