Great, you have successfully moved to the project location.

Now, we can proceed to the next step: 
creating your first Git management system.

Before we begin, 
let me introduce a few very practical features in the 'Command Line' window.
These tips can help you operate commands more effectively.

First, pay attention to the lens icon next to the input field.
You can use the search function by pressing the Tab key on your keyboard or clicking on the icon.

This is particularly useful when you haven't memorized Git commands 
or when you need to complete a command quickly.

Additionally, after clicking on the input field,
use the 'up' and 'down' arrow keys on your keyboard
to quickly fill in previously executed commands.

Next, please execute '<color=#CF001C>git init</color>'
at your project location to create your first Git management system.
