Welcome to the 'Create Your First Local Repository' stage!

First, let's quickly review what we learned in the previous stage.

In the last stage, we discussed the problems that can arise from the method of backing up files. 

These problems not only affect the efficiency of project development but also bring difficulties to project management.

Then, we introduced version control and Git, along with their features and advantages. 

It's clear that using version control in project management can be very helpful.

In this stage, we'll start learning how to use Git. 

First, let's simulate the background story for this stage. 

Once the background story is set up, let's try executing functions in Git.

To enter Git commands on the computer, you need to open the 'Command Line' window. 

The 'Command Line' is a place where users can input commands. 
It can execute many different functions on the computer, and Git commands can also be run here.

We have now unlocked the 'Command Line' window. 
Please open it first.
