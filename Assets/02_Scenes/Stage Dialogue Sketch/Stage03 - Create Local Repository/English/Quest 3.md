Excellent! You have successfully executed your first Git command.

By using 'git --version' or 'git -v', you can check the Git version currently being used on your computer. 

This command also confirms whether Git has been successfully installed on your computer.

If Git is not installed on your computer yet, 
you will need to visit Git's official website to download it.

Having executed this simple and easy-to-understand Git command, 
I believe you are now confident to go on the next command.

Next, let's execute the following command,
which is the first step in creating a Git management system. 

This command is '<color=#CF001C>git init</color>',
where 'init' is the abbreviation for 'initialize'.

This means that by executing 'git init', 
you can create a new Git management system on your computer.

However, before creating this management system,
you must first move to the project path that you want to manage.

Creating a management system in the wrong location
may track files unrelated to the project. 

According to the story,
please first move to the path where management is needed.
