Excellent! 
You have successfully executed the 'git add' command.

However, although we executed the command and the 'Command Line' returned a success message.
The 'Staging Area' window has not updated its content yet.

This is because when we interact with the 'Staging Area', 
we cannot see the results of the execution '<color=#CF001C>immediately</color>'.

Therefore, after moving files in or out of the 'Staging Area', 
remember to execute the 'git status' command to update the content.

Just like before, 
please use the 'git status' command to confirm 
whether '<color=#CF001C>Class_Notes.txt</color>' has been added to the 'Staging Area'.
