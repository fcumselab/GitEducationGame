Welcome to the 'Basic Operations in Git Staging Area' stage!

First, let's quickly review the knowledge and commands we learned in the previous stage. 

In the last stage, 
we used two Git commands: 
'git --version' and 'git init'.

The 'git init' command is the basis for creating the Git management system.
It is the first command to execute when starting to use Git.

The '.git' folder, which was created by this command.
It is the core of the Git system.

We introduced what the '.git' folder is 
and mentioned the three important areas that are contained in Git:

which is:
Working Directory
Staging Area
Repository

In this stage, we will go further into the 'Staging Area'
and control it with several Git commands.

Next, let's simulate the background story for this stage.

After setting up the simulation, 
we'll review the use of the 'Staging Area'. 

The 'Staging Area' plays an important role in the Git system, 
It acts as a bridge between the 'Working Directory' and the 'Repository'.

After modifying files in the 'Working Directory', 
you move them to the 'Staging Area' using Git commands. 

Once you moved all the changes, 
we'll use another Git command to store all the modifications in the 'Repository'.

The 'Repository' combines them into a record known as a 'commit', 
it means we create a new version.

However, we can't directly see the 'Staging Area' and 'Repository' in the 'File Manager' window.
They need to be viewed through Git commands.

Now, let's learn how to open the 'Staging Area'.
We'll use the 'Command Line' window to execute commands for this purpose.

Now, please open the 'Command Line' window first.
