Excellent! 
You have executed the 'git reset' command.

In the updated 'Staging Area' window, 
'Class_Notes.txt' is now 'Unstaged'.

Through the operation of commands, 
you have achieved the simulation goal of this stage. 

In this stage, you understood the structure of the 'Staging Area'
and learned three commands:

''git status' is to view the 'Staging Area' window.
''git add' is to add files to 'Staged'.
''git reset' is to revert files to 'Unstaged'.

You can practice using these commands again in the practice mode.
Or you can continue to the next tutorial stage. 

In the next stage, you will learn how to use more advanced commands
to control the status of the 'Staging Area'.

Finally, congratulations on completing this stage. 
You did a great job!
