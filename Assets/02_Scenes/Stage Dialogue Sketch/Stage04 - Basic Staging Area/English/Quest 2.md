Great, you've opened the 'Command Line' window.

In this stage,
the first command we need to learn is '<color=#CF001C>git status</color>'.

This command displays the contents of the 'Staging Area' in the 'Command Line' window.

In this game, 
to let you view the output clearly and easily, 
the output has been separated into the window â€” the 'Staging Area' window.

Next, please execute the '<color=#CF001C>git status</color>' command
to view the contents of the 'Staging Area'.
