Alright, through the 'git status' command, 
we can see the updated results. 

The specified file has been moved from 'Unstaged' to 'Staged'.

You can click on the previously executed 'git status' command
to observe the impact caused before and after execution.

After learning how to add files to 'Staged', 
let's learn the opposite command of 'git add'. 

The '<color=#CF001C>git reset</color>' command allows us to move files 
from 'Staged' back to 'Unstaged'.

When you do not want to commit the file to the 'Repository',
you can use this command. 

To execute 'git reset', the method is similar to entering the 'git add' command.You need to add the filename before the command.

This time, please move 'Class_Notes.txt' out of 'Staged'
And ensure the file is removed from the 'Staging Area'.

If you forget how to use the command, 
please refer to the game manual.
