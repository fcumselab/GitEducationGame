Excellent! \r\nYou have executed the 'git reset' command.
In the updated 'Staging Area' window, \r\n'Class_Notes.txt' is now 'Unstaged'.
Through the operation of commands, \r\nyou have achieved the simulation goal of this stage. 
In this stage, you understood the structure of the 'Staging Area'\r\nand learned three commands:
''git status' is to view the 'Staging Area' window.\r\n''git add' is to add files to 'Staged'.\r\n''git reset' is to revert files to 'Unstaged'.
You can practice using these commands again in the practice mode.\r\nOr you can continue to the next tutorial stage. 
In the next stage, you will learn how to use more advanced commands\r\nto control the status of the 'Staging Area'.
Finally, congratulations on completing this stage. \r\nYou did a great job!
