StageTitle,"Keeping Branches in Sync"
Story Background/Content/Story,"You are a student.
In the 'Project Management' course,
The teacher required students to team up and develop a website together.

You and your team members are managing the project with Git,
but recently encountered two problems during development.
They affected the development progress.

Problem One:
You often develop the project on two different computers.
However, you recently discovered that the 'commit history'
on Computer A is behind the version of Computer B.
The modifications from Computer B have already been uploaded to the remote repository.
To continue developing from Computer B's content,
you need to synchronize the content from the remote repository to Computer A first.

Problem Two:
During development, one of your teammates contacted you.
He hopes you can help him solve a problem that encountered during development.
To improve development efficiency,
you decide to get his remote branch and find a solution to the problem.

Facing these two problems,
how would you use your learned Git skills to solve them?"
