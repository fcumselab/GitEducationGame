Story Background/Content/Story,"You're a student.
This semester, one class requires students to prepare a presentation in the midterm week.

You spend a lot of time to prepare slides related to the course.
However, students need to control time during the presentation.
So you have to simplify the content of your report.

While making changes to the report, you want to ensure that the deleted contents can be recovered.
Thus, you decide to manage the presentation by 'backing up files'.
Please try to complete the midterm report by this method."
