StageTitle,"Creating and Pushing Remote Branches"
Story Background/Content/Story,"You are a student.
In the 'Project Management' course,
the teacher required students to team up and develop a website together.

To let team members participate in the web design together,
the team decides to manage the project with Git.
You have already created a remote repository and cloned it to your computer.

To follow development principles,
team members should develop features on their branches.
The main branch should remain stable, waiting for other branches to complete development before merging.

You decide to create a new branch for this project,
and upload the modified content to the remote repository."
