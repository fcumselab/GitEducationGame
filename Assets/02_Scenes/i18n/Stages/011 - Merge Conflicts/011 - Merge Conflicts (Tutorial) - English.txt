StageTitle,"Resolving Merge Conflicts"
Story Background/Content/Story,"You are a student, and you are taking the 'Web Programming' course.
Recently, you learned how to write code to add interaction to the web pages.

After the course, you decide to create a simple web game to review the content you learned in class.
In this game, players can click the 'increase score' button to earn points,
and click the 'reset score' button to set points to zero.

To maintain a good development environment for the project, 
you decide to manage the web project with Git.

You created two branches according to the functionality 
and completed the development of these features.

Now, please try to merge the two developed branches into the main branch."
